# tessa
=====
A collection of Python modules for calculation of various texture features.

# Features

Tessa can calculates features using these methods:

* **SFTA** (Segmentation-based Fractal Texture Analysis)
* **RPST** (Random Patch Dictionary with Soft Thresholding)
* **TODO** --LPQ (Local Phase Quantization)--
* **TODO** --RZM (Regional Zernike Moments)--
* **TODO** --BGP (Binary Gabor Patterns)--
* **TODO** --CHOG (Circular Histogram of Gradients)--

# Requirements

Tessa is written and tested for Python 2.7, and requires numpy >= 1.8

# Usage

**TODO**

# Acknowledgements and citations

Christoph Gohlke's excellent [tifffile](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/code/tifffile.py.html) code is included for reading and writing image data.

A subset of the [Kylberg Texture Dataset](http://www.cb.uu.se/~gustaf/texture/) is include for testing and demonstration purposes.

The SFTA module implements the algorithm presented by Alceu Costa in *"An Efficient Algorithm for Fractal Analysis of Textures"*, SIBGRAPI 2012. It is based on his provided [MATLAB source code](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/37933-sfta-texture-extractor/content/sfta/sfta.m)

The RPST module implements methods described by Adam Coates and Andrew Ng in *"The Importance of Encoding Versus Training with Sparse Coding and Vector Quantization"*, Proc. ICML 2011
