tessa
=====

A collection of Python modules for calculation of various texture features.

# Features

tessa calculates the following features:

* **TODO** LPQ (Local Phase Quantization)
* **TODO** RZM (Regional Zernike Moments)
* **TODO** BGP (Binary Gabor Patterns)
* **TODO** CHOG (Circular Histogram of Gradients)
* **TODO** SFTA (Segmentation-based Fractal Texture Analysis)
* RPST (Random Patch Dictionary with Soft Thresholding)

# Requirements

tessa is written and tested for Python 2.7, and requires numpy >= 1.8

# Usage

**TODO**

# Acknowledgements and citations

Christoph Gohlke's excellent [tifffile](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/code/tifffile.py.html) code is included for reading and writing image data.

A subset of the [Kylberg Texture Dataset](http://www.cb.uu.se/~gustaf/texture/) is include for testing and demonstration purposes.

The RPST module implements methods described by Adam Coates and Andrew Ng in *"The Importance of Encoding Versus Training with Sparse Coding and Vector Quantization"*, Proc. ICML 2011
